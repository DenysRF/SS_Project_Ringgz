ServerGUI and ClientGUI are executables.
A Client can connect to the Server by INetAddress and Port.
A Client's name may not include spaces or comma's.
Including if the client's name contains BOT a computer player
will automatically make moves randomly.

After connecting to the Server the Client can click "Look for game"
and when enough players have queued for a game with that many players
the game will start and the GUI will launch.
Select ring size and "color" with the radiobuttons and
click on the buttons in the 5x5 grid to make your move.
